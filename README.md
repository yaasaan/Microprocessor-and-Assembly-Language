# Microprocessor and Assembly Language

This repository contains my homework assignments and project submissions for the **"Microprocessor and Assembly Language"** course, held in **"Fall 2021"**.

The course consisted of:
- [**5 Practical Homeworks**](https://github.com/yaasaan/Microprocessor-and-Assembly-Language/tree/main/PHWs)
- [**9 Theoretical Homeworks**](https://github.com/yaasaan/Microprocessor-and-Assembly-Language/tree/main/THWs)
- [**Projects***](https://github.com/yaasaan/Microprocessor-and-Assembly-Language/tree/main/Final%20Project) 
- **Midterm Exam**
- **Final Exam**

*These arenâ€™t the final project files, just an unfinished version I managed to find after a lot of searching.
The task was to do either the first part ([keyboard](https://github.com/yaasaan/Microprocessor-and-Assembly-Language/tree/main/Final%20Project/Keyboard)) or the second part ([elevator](https://github.com/yaasaan/Microprocessor-and-Assembly-Language/tree/main/Final%20Project/Elevator)); I did the first one, and the second is not my project.
